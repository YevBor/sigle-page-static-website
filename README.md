My first project "How to learn".

The main reason of the project help me to undestand how HTML work with CSS by creating complicated layouts.

I use BEM methologie to make user friendly code for other programers. 


Vision: Practice makes Perfect. It took me more than 30 hours maybe more, to write this code.
